Hey there,

# SElectNOtes your nonstop notemaking parter
create a note on the cloud

SelectNOtes: A cloud notes app built with create-react-app, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and Mongoose

SelectNOtes is a simple but powerful notes app that I built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). It allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes, all of which are stored in a MongoDB database.

To build SelectNOtes, I used the following technologies:

Create-react-app: A tool that makes it easy to create React apps with no configuration required.


Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment that allows us to build server-side applications.


Express.js: A web framework for Node.js that makes it easy to create and manage web applications.


MongoDB: A NoSQL database that is well-suited for storing and retrieving data for modern web applications.

Mongoose: An object modeling library for MongoDB that makes it easy to interact with the database.

SelectNOtes is deployed on a cloud server, so users can access their notes from anywhere with an internet connection. The app is also responsive, so it looks great on all devices, from desktops to smartphones.

Here are some of the features of SelectNOtes:

Create, read, update, and delete notes
Organize notes into categories
Tag notes for easy searching
Share notes with others
Collaborate on notes with others
I am excited to share SelectNOtes with the world, and I hope that it will be a useful tool for anyone who needs a simple and reliable way to keep track of their notes.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
